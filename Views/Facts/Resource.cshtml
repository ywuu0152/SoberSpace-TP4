                Private, or non-governmental programs primarily provided abstinence-based treatment in a variety of settings. Some for-profit programs,
                funded by insurance, provided three to four weeks inpatient care, usually with outpatient follow-up. Not-for-profit programs provided
                residential treatment in a therapeutic community over a period of 6 months to 2 years. Still others (both profit and not-for-profit)
                provided methadone treatment or outpatient treatment.
